<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Although the term in itself may seem offputting at first, it’s extremely difficult to not at the very least acknowledge the importance of understanding it. Enshittification is known as how platforms begin as good, draw in users, then die once they begin to show their corporate greed (Doctorow). This is something that we see within the digital landscape everywhere, and Doctorow specifically targets TikTok. However, something that I believe is interesting to address is how this can go further beyond just our personal digital lives.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">In 2018, Disney released a sequel to their film ‘Wreck-It Ralph’ titled ‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’. The film focuses heavily on the digital world, but it almost seems dystopian in a way. No, not in the way that Sonic the Hedgehog appears to us, or any of the other wacky stuff that occurs, but in how everything seems fine. There doesn’t seem to be any sort of enshittification shown. Although that wouldn’t be the expectation for a Disney film to touch on that, it feels like they paint the digital world in a way that makes it seem like only the ‘dark web’ and the viruses that one may find are the only evils, when many of them are in our daily lives. Although it’s just a movie for kids, I believe that this is an interesting take on the internet that is very commonly seen within media. It’s far easier to paint the problems as simply being viruses or the supposed horrors of the dark web.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">The reason that ‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’ showing all of these various corporations in this way is rather obvious. They either paid to be in the movie for free advertising or were paid to have them in the movie. The bigger question is why they would want to be in it. Well-- the answer to that is rather obvious too. Brand recognition is one of the easiest ways to get into people’s lives without them even having to think about your company actively. It’s something that we see with Microsoft and Xbox, where they mostly market at a loss. To them, an Xbox is just another way at getting somebody to purchase a Windows computer, given all the connections that the two of them have. But what happens for these companies to need this brand recognition? Doctorow’s thoughts on TikTok seem like a prime answer.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">When it comes to brand recognition, it’s a lot easier to get away with things when you have a good reputation. Companies obviously cannot do anything that they want, but they can certainly move along the boundary between controversy and something simply blowing over. In paying to be within the movie, companies can build up this recognition. They can get their name into the minds of kids watching, so when they consider what they want to be active on, their company could potentially be one of the kid’s first thoughts. It dillutes from the actual quality of the product, rather just making it about who knows the product. This encourages enshittification once the brand is known to be what it is, and many people won’t change their minds. One might even be able to say that in this way, Ralph does truly break the internet. Disney just does it for him.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=12 data-line-end=13 ><a id="Understanding_Social_Media_12"></a>Understanding Social Media</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">Social media as a whole is something that we as people still don’t fully understand, but we have to try our best. It’s new media to all of us. Every person in our class, every person at Ball State, and even every person in the country. Just because some of us are better with it does not change that fact. The comment section is where we find most online interaction via social media, namely in three different kinds of comments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="18">Type 1: Content Focused<br>
Type 2: Appreciation<br>
Type 3: Affect<br>
(Smidebush)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">The writer of this post goes further into each individual type of comment, but I believe that only the basics are required to help better understand enshittification. All three of these comment types sound great, even healthy for the online environment. The issue is when these comments are overan by bots within comments, or hidden by the toxic comments that get more focus from users. Social Media doesn’t have to be bad, it’s instead made that way by a focus on monetization rather than moderation.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">All in all, both within Social Media and typical kinds of media (movies, books, etc.) we can see enshittification. Although the kinds in our typical media aren’t exactly what the term was made for, Disneys ‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’ is a perfect example of modern movies and the ways that they sell out to create a worse, but more profitable product.</p>
